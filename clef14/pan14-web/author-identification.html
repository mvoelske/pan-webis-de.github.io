                    <h2>Author Identification</h2>
                    <p>


                        Authorship attribution is an important problem in many areas including information retrieval and
                        computational linguistics, but also in applied areas such as law and journalism where knowing
                        the author of a document (such as a ransom note) may be able to save lives. The most common
                        framework for testing candidate algorithms is a text classification problem: given known sample
                        documents from a small, finite set of candidate authors, which if any wrote a questioned
                        document of unknown authorship? It has been commented, however, that this may be an unreasonably
                        easy task. A more demanding problem is author verification where given a set of documents by a
                        single author and a questioned document, the problem is to determine if the questioned document
                        was written by that particular author or not. This may more accurately reflect real life in the
                        experiences of professional forensic linguists, who are often called upon to answer this kind of
                        question. It is the second year PAN focuses on the so-called author verification problem.</p>
                    <p><strong>A note to forensic linguists:</strong> In order to bridge the gap between linguistics and
                        computer science, we strongly encourage submissions from researchers from both fields. We
                        understand that research groups with expertise in linguistics use manual or semi-automated
                        methods and, therefore, they are not able to submit their software. To enable their
                        participation, we will provide them with the opportunity to analyze the test corpus after the
                        deadline of software submission (mid-April). Their results will be ranked in a separate list
                        with respect to the performance of the software submissions and they will be entitled to
                        describe their approach in a paper.
                        In this framework, any scholar or research group with expertise in
                        linguistics wishing to participate should contact the Task Chair.

                    <h3>Task</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given a small set (no more than 5, possibly as few as one) of "known" documents by a single
                        person and a "questioned" document, the task is to determine whether the questioned document was
                        written by the same person who wrote the known document set.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Training Corpus</h3>
                    <p>To develop your software, we provide you with a training corpus that comprises a set of author
                        verification problems in several languages/genres. Each problem consists of some (up to five)
                        known documents by a single person and exactly one questioned document. All documents within a
                        single problem instance will be in the same language and best efforts are applied to assure that
                        within-problem documents are matched for genre, register, theme, and date of writing. The
                        document lengths vary from a few hundred to a few thousand words.</p>

                    <p>The ground truth data of the training corpus found in the file <code>truth.txt</code> include one
                        line per problem with problem ID and the correct binary answer (Y means the known and the
                        questioned documents are by the same author and N means the opposite). For example:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">EN001 N
EN002 Y
EN003 N
...
</pre>


                    <h3>Output</h3>
                    <p>Your software must take as input the absolute path to a set of problems. For each problem there
                        is a separate sub-folder within that path including the set of known documents and the single
                        unknown document of that problem (similarly to the training corpus). The software has to output
                        a single text file <code>answers.txt</code> with all the produced answers for the whole set of
                        evaluation problems. Each line of this file corresponds to a problem instance, it starts with
                        the ID of the problem followed by a score, a real number in [0,1] inclusive, corresponding to
                        the probability of a positive answer. That is, 0 means it is absolutely sure the questioned
                        document is not by the author of the known documents, 1.0 means it is absolutely sure the
                        questioned document and the known documents are by the same author, and 0.5 means that a
                        positive and a negative answer are equally likely. The probability scores should be round with
                        three decimal digits. Use a single whitespace to separate problem ID and probability score.<br/>
                        For example, an <code>answers.txt</code> file may look like this:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py" style="overflow-x:auto">EN001 0.031
EN002 0.874
EN003 0.500
...
</pre>

                    <h3>Performance Measures</h3>
                    <p>The participants’ answers will be evaluated according to the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of
                        their probability scores.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the performance of the binary classification results (automatically extracted from
                        probability scores where every score greater than 0.5 corresponds to a positive answer, every
                        score lower than 0.5 corresponds to a negative answer, while 0.5 corresponds to an unanswered
                        problem, or an "I don’t know" answer) will be measured based on c@1 (<a
                                href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1142.pdf">Pe&ntilde;as &amp; Rodrigo, 2011</a>):

                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Note:</b> when positive/negative answers are provided for all available problems (probability
                        scores different than 0.5), then c@1=accuracy. However, c@1 rewards approaches that maintain the
                        same number of correct answers and decrease the number of incorrect answers by leaving some
                        problems unanswered (when probability score equals 0.5).</p>
                    <p>The final ranking of the participants will be based on the <b>product of AUC and c@1.</b></p>

                    <h3>Test Corpus</h3>
                    <p>Once you finished tuning your approach to achieve satisfying performance on the training corpus,
                        your software will be tested on the evaluation corpus.</p>
                    <p>During the competition, the evaluation corpus will not be released publicly. Instead, we ask you
                        to submit your software for evaluation at our site as described below.</p>
                    <p>After the competition, the evaluation corpus will become available including ground truth data.
                        This way, you have all the necessities to evaluate your approach on your own, yet being
                        comparable to those who took part in the competition.</p>

                        training, and one for testing. This way, your software can be reused on future evaluation
                        corpora as well as on private collections submitted to PAN by via our data submission

                    <p>Based on the classification model, the software shall classifiy each case found in the test
                        corpus and write an output file as described above to the output directory.</p>
                    <p>However, <b>offering a command for training is optional</b>, so if you face difficulties in doing
                        so, you may skip the training command and omit the model option <b>-m</b> from the testing
                        command.</p>
                    <p>You can choose freely among the available programming languages and among the operating systems
                        Microsoft Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04. We will ask you to deploy your software onto a virtual
                        machine that will be made accessible to you after registration. You will be able to reach the
                        virtual machine via ssh and via remote desktop. More information about how to access the virtual
                        machines can be found in the user guide below</p>

                    <p>Once deployed in your virtual machine, your can move to submit your software. Before doing so, we
                        provide your with a software submission readiness tester. Please use this tester to verify that
                        your software works. Since we will be calling your software automatically in much the same ways
                        as the tester does, this lowers the risk ot errors.</p>

                        <li>The output of your software must be composed of real (probability) scores rather than binary
                            Y/N answers
                        </li>
                        <li>The maximum number of documents of known authorship within a problem is 5 (instead of 10)
                        </li>
                        <li>The evaluation measures used for ranking are (ROC) AUC and c@1 instead of recall, precision
                            and F1
                        </li>
