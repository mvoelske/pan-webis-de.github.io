                        <p>Recently I was asked to assist in a text attribution problem: the illegitimate reuse of text
                            (and images) from the web pages of a small business. When the offender was approached about
                            committing possible plagiarism their response was ?prove it?. This talk will describe how I
                            approached the problem of proving ownership and the challenges it entailed. I will describe
                            the experiences gained from working on the EPSRC-funded Measuring Text Reuse (METER) project
                            with the UK Press Association, along with the current text attribution literature, that
                            informed my textual analysis. I will also demonstrate how freely available resources can be
                            used to tackle this kind of problem. In the end was I successful: did the offender admit
                            their guilt? You?ll have to attend the talk to find out!

                                    Press Association on a project entitled ?Measuring Text Reuse?. Following various
                                    interests in NLP and Information Retrieval, Paul worked as a researcher on a range
                                    of projects until 2005 when he became a Lecturer in the Information School. Paul is

                        <p>Personality recognition from text consists in the automatic classification of authors'
                            personality traits from pieces of text they wrote. Classifier's predictions can be compared
                            against gold standard labels, obtained by means of personality assessments like the Big5
                            personality test. Until recently, the extraction of personality types was limited to blogs
                            and offline texts, while in recent years there is a strong interest in the scientific
                            community about the extraction of personality from various sources, such as online social
                            networks, speech and video. Current approaches to Personality Recognition are based on
                            supervised learning, but this has several limitations, for example the cost of data
                            annotation, the lack of domain adaptability and multilinguality. We present an unsupervised
                            method for personality recognition from text and some of its applications in Social network
                            analysis as well as in other NLP tasks.
