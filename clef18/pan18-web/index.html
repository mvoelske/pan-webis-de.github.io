                    <p>In this talk I will review some recent results regarding early detection
                        of signs of
                        depression and anorexia. Since 2017, we have been organizing eRisk, a CLEF lab that
                        promotes the development of effective and efficient solutions for early risk prediction
                        on the Internet. eRisk explores the evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics and
                        practical applications (particularly those related to health and safety) of early risk
                        detection on the Internet. Early detection technologies can be employed in different
                        areas, particularly those related to health and safety. For instance, early alerts could
                        be sent when a predator starts interacting with a child for sexual purposes, or when a
                        potential offender starts publishing antisocial threats on a blog, forum or social
                        network. Our main goal is to pioneer a new interdisciplinary research area that would be
                        potentially applicable to a wide variety of situations and to many different personal
                        profiles. Examples include potential paedophiles, stalkers, individuals that could fall
                        into the hands of criminal organisations, people with suicidal inclinations, or people
                        susceptible to depression. In this talk, I will discuss the lessons learned over these
                        two years and some future lines of work.

                        in Computer Science & Artificial
                        Intelligence at the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain). He is currently the
                        Director of the Master's Programme on Big Data Analytics. David E. Losada received his BS in
                        Computer Science (with honors) in 1997, and his PhD in Computer Science (with
                        honors) in 2001, both from the University of A Coruña (Spain). From 2001 to 2002, he was
                        a lecturer in the San Pablo-CEU University (Spain) and, in 2003, he joined the Univ. of
                        Santiago de Compostela as a senior research fellow ("Ramón y Cajal" R&D programme). His
                        current research interests include a wide range of Information Retrieval (IR) and
                        related areas such as: early risk detection, text mining, IR evaluation, IR
                        probabilistic models, summarization, novelty detection, and sentence retrieval. Losada
                        is an active member of the IR community and he regularly serves in the Programme
                        Committee of prestigious international conferences such as SIGIR or ECIR. He has also
                        led several R&D projects and contracts in the area of search technologies. In 2011,
                        Losada was recognized with an ACM senior member award. David started the organization of
                        eRisk in 2017. eRisk is a CLEF lab that promotes the development of effective and

                    <p>The drastic change in the Web was witnessed throughout the past decade,
                        which saw an
                        exponential growth in social networking services. Traditionally, social network users
                        are encouraged to complete their profiles by explicitly providing their personal
                        attributes such as age, gender, interests, etc. Such information is essential for
                        Marketing, Facility Arrangement, or Candidate Assessment, but, unfortunately, often not
                        publicly available. This gives rise to user profiling, which aims at automatic inference
                        of individual user attributes based on their social network interactions. Considering
                        that human beings frequently contribute multi-modal data in multiple online social
                        networks at the same time, it is essential to implement inter-source complimentary
                        multi-view learning techniques to perform automaticuser profiling efficiently. In this
                        talk, we will overview recent research attempts on learning across multiple social
                        networks and data modalities for automatic user profiling. We will also give several
                        practical examples of how Multi-View User Profiling helps SoMin.ai in boosting the
                        efficiency of enterprises' marketing efforts.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>There is much concern about algorithms that underlie information
                        services and the view of
                        the social world they present to users. Image search engines are known to perpetuate
                        gender stereotypes, particularly surrounding professions (e.g., returning primarily
                        images of men on a search for "engineer," although few, if any, men on a search for
                        "nurse"). In the first part of the talk, I discuss the problem of detecting social
                        biases in image search results. We developed a novel method for automatically examining
                        the content and strength of gender stereotypes in image results, which is inspired by
                        the trait adjective checklist method. In experiments with Microsoft Bing, we found that
                        photos of women are more often retrieved for searches on warm character traits (e.g.,
                        "emotional"), whereas agentic traits (e.g., "rational") typically result in more images
                        of men. In the second part of the talk, I address questions surrounding the origin of
                        social biases in search algorithms. I will argue that the quality of image metadata is a
                        source of bias, as algorithms are typically trained on "gold standard," human-produced
                        metadata. Specifically, in an experiment testing a commonly used crowdsourcing task for
                        metadata generation, I will provide evidence that people's descriptions of men and women
                        depicted in similar contexts differ in systematic ways that are predictable by theory.
                        In conclusion, I shall argue that while the reproduction of social stereotypes in search
                        algorithms is likely inevitable, there are ways to effectively raise users' awareness of
                        biases in results.</p>
