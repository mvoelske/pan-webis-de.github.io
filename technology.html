                digital text forensics technology. For reproducibility sake, the prototypes submitted for evaluation are made
                available by participants open source, as executables on TIRA, or both. The choice of license is at the discretion of

                    <p>Many researchers do not share their code cause it's not polished,
                        they have no time to provide support, or for fear of competition. This may be true, yet,
                        researchers who share their code may have a lasting impact on their community. Others who adopt
                        their code will cite it, ultimately adding to the sharer's reputation. Sharing is thinking long-term.</p>

                <p class="uk-text-lead">At PAN, it is our goal to carry out reproducible research. While the evaluation resources
                    created for our shared tasks benefit future evaluations, even shared tasks lack reproducibility.
                    Therefore, we ask participants to submit working executables of their software. To facilitate the
                    submission of software, we employ TIRA (<a href="https://www.tira.io/" target="_blank">tira.io</a>), a
                    platform that implements the evaluation as a service paradigm.</p>

                        We will set up a virtual machine (VM) for you and pass you the access credentials. You can
                        access your VM via SSH and remote desktop. Once you have access, please install your
                        software inside the virtual machine.</p>

                    <h2>Why submit software?</h2>

                    <p >Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of science; yet,
                        in recent years it was shown that many scientific contributions are irreproducible. For
                        shared tasks in particular, the software developed by participants often go missing soon
                        after the event has passed. Moreover, the test datasets used in shared tasks are released to
                        participants, creating an evaluation bias. All of these problems are solved by submitting
                        software instead of their run output.</p>

                    <p>To work with TIRA, your software has to be executable from the command line and it must accept the following parameters:</p>

                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
                        <li>A path to an input dataset.</li>

                        <li>A path to the output of a previous run of the software (optional).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Once your software is installed in your VM, you can remote control its evaluation via TIRA's web interface.</p>
