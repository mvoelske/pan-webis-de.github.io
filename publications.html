            <p class="uk-text-lead">All participants of PAN's shared tasks are invited to share their insights in the
                form of
                scientific papers. The papers comprise high-level descriptions of the digital text forensics
                technologies
                invented by participants to solve a given task. They are typically published in the context of
                conferences that
                host PAN's events, or as dedicated workshop proceedings.</p>
