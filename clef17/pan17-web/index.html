                    <p>Researchers have used large quantities of online data to study dynamics in novel ways. Consider
                        the specific case of online networked individuals sharing geo-located, multimodal, pieces of
                        information in social media platforms, e.g., users of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. Can their
                        social dynamics be used to unveil the hidden dimensions that regulate the social life of our
                        cities? To answer this question, our research has focused on understanding how people
                        psychologically experience cities and, as a result, we have created new mapping tools that
                        capture the aesthetic, olfactory and sonic layers of our cities, modeling happiness and use of
                        figurative language, e.g., irony. The work presented in this talk mixes data mining, urban
                        informatics, and computational social science to study how these dimensions relate to
                        demographic, e.g., age or gender, and socio-economic factors, e.g., education, crime, race, or
                        wealth, that characterize the profile of the modern urban fabric.

                    <p>Authorship profiling and text-based deception detection have been the focus of attention in
                        recent years, partly because of a rapid growth of Internet communication and necessity to detect
                        fraud in online reviews and dating profiles, reveal suicidal tendencies in authors of texts on
                        social media, as well as to assess who likes/dislikes these or those products and services
                        (male, female, extroverts…) using linguistic analysis of their reviews, etc. Industrial
                        companies are in need of techniques for quick and valid assessment of candidates’ intelligence
                        and personality, and analyzing texts could provide such opportunities. Author profiling and
                        deception detection domain is rapidly developing but not for Slavic languages. They have long
                        been beyond the scope of relevant studies, which is largely due to the fact that there were no
                        corresponding text corpora available and no efficient methods of natural language processing in
                        place. In this keynote we present the results of the research aimed at deception detection and
                        personality and gender recognition in Russian written texts. In this research RusPersonality was
                        used, which is by far the largest corpus of written texts in Slavic languages with rich metadata
                        (information on the authors of the texts – gender, age, occupation, scores on different
                        personality traits, results of neuropsychological assessment, etc. and information on the texts
                        – genre, topic, deceptive/truthful, etc.). The second source of material for research conducted
                        in RusProfiling Lab is social media. In most of the experiments topic-independent features were
                        used. Special attention in the talk will be paid to the estimation of a likelihood of
                        self-destructive (including suicidal as the most severe form) behavior using linguistic analyses
                        of writing. The keynote concludes by encouraging a discussion on the necessity to seek for
                        topic-independent and language-independent features in authorship profiling and for explanation
                        of the estimated correlations between linguistics parameters of written texts and
                        characteristics of their authors.</p>

                        authorship profiling and deception detection have been funded by leading Russian scientific
                        funds. Lab is also in collaboration with industrial companies to get real-world data and to
                        develop authorship profiling techniques that would come in handy in HR. Tatiana has a PhD in
                        Russian Linguistics from Voronezh State University (Voronezh, Russia). She is one of the
                        organizers of RusProfiling Shared Task on Gender Prediction in Cross-Genre perspective which
