                        <p>To detect deception in communications is a difficult task for humans and a critical issue in
                            police investigations. In fact, no specific signs of deception, such as the Pinocchio's
                            growing nose, have never been clearly identified, even though several approaches have been
                            developed in order to unmask liars and the false information they convey. The speech will
                            examine the problem in the perspective of police practices, from collection to evaluation of
                            testimonies. The contribution of different techniques and technologies for testimonies'
                            analysis will be discussed, with particular focus on the role of the modern stylometry, as
                            many studies in literature suggest that the discipline, which exploits computational methods
                            in order to analyze samples of spoken and written language through their stylistic features,
                            can be effectively employed in deception detection.

                                <p>Tommaso Fornaciari is a Police Officer Psychologist of Italian National Police. Since
                                    2003 he worked at the Forensic Science Police Service, dealing with crime scene
                                    analysis, behavioral analysis and investigative data analysis, mostly regarding
                                    bloody murders. With the purpose of supporting the analysis of testimonies, in 2009
                                    he began to attend the PhD school of the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences - CIMeC of
                                    the University of Trento, where he carried out a research project in forensic
                                    linguistics (Ph.D. in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, 2012). In particular, he applied
                                    computational techniques in order to detect deception in transcripts of hearings
                                    held in Italian Courts. He is going ahead with research in deception detection and
                                    currently he works at the Italian Ministry of Interior, where he is engaged in
                                    research and technological innovation for public security.</p>

                        <p>In this talk I will describe recent research within the CLiPS research centre on author
                            profiling: the automatic assignment of demographic and psychological properties to (unknown)
                            authors of text on the basis of linguistic analysis of these texts. I will describe
                            different ways in which the results of this research are currently being applied. In the
                            AMiCA project, the goal is to help moderators of social networks to detect harmful
                            situations in their network. Our case studies concern cyberbullying, pedophile grooming, and
                            suicide announcements. I wil show how profiling information can help achieve these tasks. In
                            addition I will briefly demo the profiling system of Textgain, a spin-off company from
                            CLiPS, and describe some of the applications in which their profiling web services are put
                            to use.
