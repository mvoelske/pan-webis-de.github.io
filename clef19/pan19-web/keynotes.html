                        <p>The Internet and online social networks have amplified information
                            diffusion processes, but at the same time, they provide fertile ground
                            for the spread of misinformation, rumors, and hoaxes. The goal of this
                            work is to introduce a simple modeling framework to study these
                            phenomena: following the epidemic approach and motivated by results in
                            literature, we look at misinformation as an instance of the more
                            general concept of information diffusion, and we propose an adaption
                            of the classic SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model to the
                            case of misinformation by adding two essential socio-cognitive
                            features: forgetting and competition with fact-checking efforts.
                            First, we focus on how the availability of debunking information may
                            contain the misinformation diffusion. Our approach allows to
                            quantitatively gauge the minimal reaction necessary to eradicate a
                            hoax. Second, we simulate the spreading dynamics on networks with two
                            communities of gullible and skeptic users, with different propensities
                            to believe hoaxes and a segregation parameter that represents the
                            sparsity of links between the two communities. Simulations show that
                            segregation plays an important role in the diffusion of
                            misinformation, but can have different effects varying other
                            parameters. Finally, we validate our model on Twitter data (both fake
                            news and debunking), obtaining good results. Our encouraging findings
                            suggest that fact-checking can be still considered useful in fighting
                            misinformation, but also that the structure of the underlying social
                            network is very important in the spreading process evolution, then
                            further investigation in this direction is absolutely necessary in
                            order to develop new tools and solutions to limit the diffusion of
                            fake news.
